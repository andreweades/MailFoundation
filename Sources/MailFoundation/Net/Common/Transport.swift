// MARK: - Transport Protocol

/// A protocol defining low-level network transport operations.
///
/// `Transport` provides a simple abstraction over network connections,
/// supporting basic open, close, read, and write operations. It is used
/// by mail service implementations to communicate with servers.
///
/// ## Implementations
///
/// - ``StreamTransport``: Built on Foundation `InputStream`/`OutputStream`
/// - ``TcpTransport``: Direct TCP socket implementation
/// - ``PosixSocketTransport``: POSIX socket-based implementation
///
/// ## Usage Pattern
///
/// ```swift
/// let transport: Transport = StreamTransport(input: inputStream, output: outputStream)
/// transport.open()
/// defer { transport.close() }
///
/// let written = transport.write(Array("EHLO example.com\r\n".utf8))
/// let response = transport.readAvailable(maxLength: 4096)
/// ```
public protocol Transport: AnyObject {
    /// Opens the transport connection.
    ///
    /// Call this method before performing any read or write operations.
    /// It is safe to call this method multiple times; subsequent calls
    /// have no effect if the transport is already open.
    func open()

    /// Closes the transport connection.
    ///
    /// After closing, the transport cannot be used for further operations.
    /// It is safe to call this method multiple times.
    func close()

    /// Writes data to the transport.
    ///
    /// This method attempts to write all provided bytes to the transport.
    /// It may block until all data is written or an error occurs.
    ///
    /// - Parameter bytes: The data to write.
    /// - Returns: The number of bytes actually written, which may be less
    ///   than the input length if an error occurred.
    func write(_ bytes: [UInt8]) -> Int

    /// Reads available data from the transport.
    ///
    /// This method returns immediately with whatever data is available,
    /// up to the specified maximum length. If no data is available,
    /// it returns an empty array.
    ///
    /// - Parameter maxLength: The maximum number of bytes to read.
    /// - Returns: The data read, or an empty array if no data is available.
    func readAvailable(maxLength: Int) -> [UInt8]
}

// MARK: - StartTlsTransport Protocol

/// A transport that supports upgrading to TLS encryption.
///
/// `StartTlsTransport` extends ``Transport`` with the ability to upgrade
/// an unencrypted connection to TLS, as required by the STARTTLS command
/// in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols.
///
/// ## STARTTLS Flow
///
/// 1. Connect to server on standard port
/// 2. Perform initial protocol handshake
/// 3. Send STARTTLS command
/// 4. Call ``startTLS(validateCertificate:)``
/// 5. Continue with encrypted communication
public protocol StartTlsTransport: Transport {
    /// Optional channel binding data for SCRAM-PLUS authentication.
    ///
    /// Transports that can access TLS session details should expose a
    /// ``ScramChannelBinding`` (typically `tls-server-end-point`).
    var scramChannelBinding: ScramChannelBinding? { get }

    /// Upgrades the connection to use TLS encryption.
    ///
    /// This method performs the TLS handshake and upgrades the
    /// connection to encrypted mode. After this call completes
    /// successfully, all subsequent reads and writes are encrypted.
    ///
    /// - Parameter validateCertificate: If `true`, validates the server's
    ///   certificate against trusted roots. Set to `false` only for
    ///   testing with self-signed certificates.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Disabling certificate validation exposes the connection
    ///   to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    func startTLS(validateCertificate: Bool)
}

// MARK: - CompressionTransport Protocol

/// A transport that supports enabling IMAP COMPRESS.
///
/// IMAP compression is negotiated at the protocol level and then the transport
/// begins compressing subsequent reads and writes.
public protocol CompressionTransport: Transport {
    /// Enables compression for subsequent reads and writes.
    ///
    /// - Parameter algorithm: The negotiated compression algorithm (e.g., "DEFLATE").
    func startCompression(algorithm: String) throws
}

// MARK: - StreamTransport

/// A transport implementation based on Foundation streams.
///
/// `StreamTransport` wraps `InputStream` and `OutputStream` to provide
/// a ``Transport`` interface. It is useful when you already have Foundation
/// streams available, such as from `Stream.getStreamsToHost()`.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// var inputStream: InputStream?
/// var outputStream: OutputStream?
/// Stream.getStreamsToHost(withName: "mail.example.com", port: 25,
///                         inputStream: &inputStream, outputStream: &outputStream)
///
/// guard let input = inputStream, let output = outputStream else {
///     throw ConnectionError.failed
/// }
///
/// let transport = StreamTransport(input: input, output: output)
/// transport.open()
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is not thread-safe. Access from multiple threads must be
/// externally synchronized.

    /// The input stream for reading data.
